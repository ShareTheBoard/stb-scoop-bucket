# About

DO NOT REMOVE THIS.

The purpose of this repository is to contain configuration files for the scoop tool. It contains specific version and location information for installing the [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) tool.

The AutoHotkey tool is used in the workflow for [ShareTheBoard](https://github.com/ShareTheBoard/sharetheboard-web) and the [Content Camera Deploy](https://github.com/ShareTheBoard/sharetheboard-web/blob/master/.github/workflows/content-camera-deploy.yml) workflow, specifically in the step involving certificate generation and the automation of login for the SimpleSign Desktop application. See this [GitHub action](https://github.com/ShareTheBoard/sharetheboard-web/blob/master/.github/actions/setup-code-sign/action.yml) for more details.
